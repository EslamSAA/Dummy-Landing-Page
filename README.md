# Landing Page Project

This project aims to emulate real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality in use serves two purposes: appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

The project is mainly building a multi-section landing page, dynamically building the navigation menu, and adding improvements to the user experience by differentiating the section actively being viewed, and providing smooth-scrolling when a link is clicked on a navigation item rather than the default jump.

This is a demo landing page. The main functionalities include the following:
- Clicking the "Load More Sections" button at the bottom of the Landing Page
    - adds 2 more sections to the page, which are also reflected on the navigation bar
    - the button disappears after adding enough (9) Sections
- Clicking items on the navigation bar to jump to the desired section
    - smooth-scrolling navigating through the page
- While scrolling/reading, the active section is differentiated with a unique style
